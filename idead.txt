"Okay, let me check if your credentials are valid..."
"Your credentials look good. I am going to create a JWT, sign it with my private key, and give it to you now."
"I know we just talked, but I still have to verify the JWT I just issued you. Let me use my public key to verify it."
"Looks good! Here is your profile page."
